# Constitution

## Preamble

It is important to recognize the danger that bureaucracy can get in the way of doing cool things. This constitution is an attempt to provide the means to ensure that the cult can run smoothly and it should be invoked in compliance with the spirit of the cult.

## Article 1: Cult Name and Purpose

### 1: Name

The cult name has not been finalised yet, so, as a placeholder, the name *foss@bphc* will be used in all documents referring to the cult. If and when a permanent name has been decided, this section shall be amended.

### 2: Purpose

The purpose of foss@bphc is to write and advocate free software, and to create a community of excellent programmers.

The cult shall take no 'official' stance on political debates among the open source community, and shall not place any constraints on the type of project and/or tools used to accomplish the tasks by the members, as long as the project worked on by members of the cult, under the flag of the cult, and distributed by the cult should meet some acceptable definition of open source software.

## Article 2: Membership

The cult has three main types of memberships to offer:

### 1. Active Membership

Active Membership is the default membership offered by the induction process to the student body of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

#### 1. Selection

All currently enrolled students are eligible for becoming active members of the cult and can sit for bi-weekly inductions. A person shall be inducted into the cult only after passing a vote of more than 66% of the Core Members of the cult.

#### 2. Expectations

All active members are expected to:

1. Provide daily updates of the projects that they are working on.
2. Be active on cult mailing list and Telegram Group.
3. Complete tasks assigned to them on time.
4. Attend all meets and coding sessions of the cult.
5. Complete at least 1 project in an unfamiliar technology each semester.

If for some reason a member is unable to fulfill one of the above expectations, they are required to intimate at least one core member in advance of the problem.

#### 3. Removal

Active members get three credits each semester. Failure to comply with the expectations would lead to deduction of one credit for each such event. If a member's credits reach 0, they shall be removed from the cult.

Should another cause for membership removal be raised, a member can be removed by a two thrids majority vote of Core Members, providing there is at least a week's notice of the vote.

### 2. Core Membership

Core members are the governing members of the cult in regards to decisions including but not limited to membership related issues, official representation of the cult, changes to the constitution and use of resources allocated to the cult. The core members shall act as a team of Benevolent Dictators.

#### 1. Selection

Core Membership is offered only to Active Members of the cult. All core members have veto powers with regards to selection of new core members.

#### 2. Expectations

In addition to their expectations as Active Members, Core Members are expected to:

1. Distribute cult administration duties among themselves.
2. Complete all administrative tasks on time.
3. Be present for all votes.

If for some reason a Core Member is unable to fulfill one of the above expectations, they are required to intimate at least one other Core Member in advance of the problem.

### 3. Advisory Membership

Advisory Members are the goto persons for when there is something that the Cult cannot resolve on its own.

#### 1. Selection

Advisory Membership is offered to ex-Core Members of the cult that have since ceased to be the members of the Student Body of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

#### 2. Powers

Advisory Members can call a Cult Vote.

#### 3. Removal

Advisory Members cannot be removed. However, they can leave the Cult if they so choose to.

## Article 3: Cult Terminologies

## Article 4: Amendment of Constitution

The Cult Constitution can be amended by a 66% majority vote of all Core Members. Frequent changes to the constitution are encouraged to attain stability - the state when the Constitution suits the working of the cult well. 

### 1. Making Changes

All major changes shall be pushed to a github repository with the commit message `Constitution Revision: <details of revision>`. Minor changes like correction of spelling or grammatical errors should not be committed with such a message. Only commits matching the described format will be counted towards deeming stability of the constitution.

### 2. On Attaining Stability

The contitution shall be deemed stable if there have been no amendments for a period of 1 month. Content of Article 4 shall be replaced by the following text:

> The Cult Constitution can be amended by a 66% majority vote of all Active Members called at least 1 week in advance.
