<h1 id="kushagra-agrawal">Kushagra Agrawal</h1>
<p>I am a 2014 Batch Undergrad Student of BPHC majoring in Electronics and Communications. I love to code in C++, Java and Python. I am primarily interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and its applications in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<h3 id="ann-model-for-energy-efficiency-of-hpc-computing-nodes">ANN Model for Energy Efficiency of HPC Computing Nodes</h3>
<p>The project aimed at developing a Artificial Neural Network model to model the energy efficient of HPC Computing Nodes. The Energy aware features of modern processors was utilised as input parameters for the ANN model. I did this project in my PS-1. You are more than welcome to check it on <a href="https://github.com/kushagraagrawal/PS-1-Project">Github</a></p>
<h3 id="using-deep-learning-for-image-classification">Using Deep Learning for Image Classification</h3>
<p>This project deals with using Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques for Image Classification. The long-term goal of this project is to extrapolate the baseline results of what 
we got for Image Classification to Video Classification of the UFC 101 data set.
We used the standard CIFAR 10 data set for classification and accomplished the following:
1) Using traditional Machine Learning classifiers like SVM with linear and RBF kernels, Random Forest Classifiers on features extracted using Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Coloured Histogram Approaches for Image Classification.
2) Classifying the CIFAR 10 data set using Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras with a Theano back end.
3) Using transfer learning to fine tune the pretrained VGG16 architecture on the ImageNet challenge data set so as to classify CIFAR10 images.</p>
<h3 id="finding-evidence-for-interruptibility-prediction-using-artificial-intelligence">Finding evidence for interruptibility prediction using Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>I am currently doing this project in collaboration with the Center for Digital Health Interventions at ETH Zurich &amp; University of St. Gallen. The aim of the project is to find suitable features that can be used to predict interruptibility i.e. the most productive time to interrupt a person.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-analysis-of-twitter-data-to-predict-political-outcomes">Real-time analysis of Twitter data to predict political outcomes</h3>
<p>I am currently doing this project on campus.The aim of the project is to analyze public opinion about political scenarios by analyzing a real-time stream of Twitter data and try to understand what implications different political developments have in the overall political scenario. A further aim is to try to analyze the correlation with the results to try to find out how representative our sample is and try to develop a cost function for the same.</p>
