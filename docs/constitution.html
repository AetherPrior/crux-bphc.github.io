<h1 id="constitution">Constitution</h1>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>It is important to recognize the danger that bureaucracy can get in the way of doing cool things. This constitution is an attempt to provide the means to ensure that the guild can run smoothly and it should be invoked in compliance with the spirit of the guild.</p>
<h2 id="article-1-guild-name-and-purpose">Article 1: Guild Name and Purpose</h2>
<h3 id="1-name">1: Name</h3>
<p>The guild name has not been finalised yet, so, as a placeholder, the name <em>foss@bphc</em> will be used in all documents referring to the guild. If and when a permanent name has been decided, this section shall be amended.</p>
<h3 id="2-purpose">2: Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of foss@bphc is to write and advocate free software, and to create a community of excellent programmers.</p>
<p>The guild shall take no &#39;official&#39; stance on any political debates circulated among the open source community, and shall not place any constraints on the type of project and/or tools used to accomplish the tasks by the members. </p>
<p>This freedom is applicable as long as the project worked on by members of the guild, under the flag of the guild, and distributed by the guild should meet some acceptable definition of open source software.</p>
