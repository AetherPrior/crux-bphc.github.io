Pull requests are welcome. 

# Creating member pagess
Website is now generated by Jekyll using Github Pages. See https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/. Most member pages have been removed, and been placed in members_backup, but creating them should be easy enough as no HTML is required.

https://domchristie.github.io/turndown/ can be used to convert any backup page to markdown, and then it can be placed in _members in a format similar to the other files in that directory.

Make these changes and create a pull request so that your member page can be added.
