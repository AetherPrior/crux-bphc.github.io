I'm a CompSci undergrad at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus from the 2017 batch, with a keen interest in programming and scripting. Started programming for the simple motive of making my life easier (and others' in the process as well ;P). I really enjoy finding novel and beautiful ways to solve a problem, and keep striving to perfect my code :)
