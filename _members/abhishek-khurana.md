I am a 2018 Batch Undergrad Student at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani – Hyderabad campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/). I’m interested in 3D Rendering , Digital Image Processing and Parallel Processing on GPUs(using [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) for Nvidia GPUs).

Projects
--------

### 3D Rendering Engine that runs on CPU

This project explores using a 3D rendering engine running on the CPU , to execute compute shaders that are inefficient to run on the GPU.  
**Additional Goals :**

*   Implement a VR solution
*   Implement Occlusion Culling

**Some Outputs :**

### Image To ASCII Art Converter

This project converts all the pixels of an image into closest looking ASCII characters.

### Ball Balancing

This project aims at balancing a ball on a platform that has 2 degrees of rotational freedom. It works by calculating the balls position using basic digital image processing and then uses a PID controller to balance it. **This was a team project done by Tech Team members of [PHoEnix Association - BPHC](https://www.facebook.com/phoenix.bphc/).** The Source Code is available on [Github](https://github.com/abhishekkhurana12345/Ball-Balancing).
